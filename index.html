        <div class="subheading mb-5">Full-Time Student ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Anna Lucia Monterroso, I am a first year student at the University of Riverside, California and am currently employed as a part-time Courtesy Clerk at Sprouts Farmers Market (Store 210). My prior work experience include: a position at Candlelight Pavilion in Claremont, California as a waitress, a lead position at Raging Waters, San Dimas, and a cashier position at the American Cancer Society in Upland, California. I am bilingual, and able to speak, write, and understand Spanish and English.  My hobbies include: reading, playing guitar, and writing letters to my loved ones. <br><br>

        My experience of growing up in a socioeconomically disadvantaged community along with my involvement in community service have shaped my interest in community outreach.  One of my most significant community activities has been volunteering at the American Cancer Society (ACS) since 2017, a non profit organization for cancer research. Specifically, I volunteered full-time, two times a week, every week at a local Discovery Shop sponsored by the American Cancer Society. The mission of the shop is two-fold: to provide quality and low-cost merchandise to the community from kind donations and to use the profits to enhance American Cancer Society efforts in combating cancer. My involvement has ranged from daily tasks such as working at the front desk helping customers to co-leading staff meetings discussing fundraising opportunities and potential changes to the Discovery Shop.Perhaps my most significant impact as a volunteer has been advocating for the use of innovative technology. My local Discovery Shop had been using the same cash register for over 30 years and had not invested in any change. In fact, most staff members were hesitant about the use of a newer cash register since it meant new learning obstacles and potential slowing for customer service. However, I strongly believe that change can yield progress and I was inspired to apply this belief for the better of my community. Thus, I advocated at staff meetings and with the help of staff members and volunteer colleagues, we were able to purchase a new cash register along with new effective storage containers for future merchandise. The benefits have been unparalleled as the shop now carries their daily tasks more smoothly and the customers experience a faster and more effective shopping experience.<br><br>

        My involvement within the American Cancer Society has been a gratifying experience within itself, however, discovering my own personal power has been another. Being able to directly observe local customers benefiting from donations and knowing a change I advocated for made it possible is incredibly fulfilling. I hope to continue to work together with diverse groups and communities to further develop my own leadership skills.    Through my involvement within the American Cancer Society organization, I have learned the value and weight of Personal Engagement and hope to continue to integrate it within a career that encourages social responsibility. My biggest goal for the future is to begin interacting and interning with outreach community organizations with my similar values, such as inclusion and diversity.
